text = "This isn’t quite how I imagined my transfer from Distribution ending up. My limbs are aching to the core. I can’t even write this, only the recording function on this VerboPrompter is allowing me to record these thoughts at all.

Then again, I don’t exactly have a great track record when it comes to accepting transferrals to begin with. This was supposed to be a more comfortable way to serve time - for something I didn't do! - carefreely manicuring these big shots' malfunctioning railway system, but suddenly I was yanked away to go through these horrible \"enhancements\" for being \"young and pretty\".

I think all that was just geemerdung to try and calm me down, even though that one lady did seem oddly nice. Maybe she's also having doubts about her relocation."
