Ever since arriving here, I've felt my true calling slowly creeping into view, like the red giant behind the Observation Deck's curved windows. I never really cared for its books, but watching the ships coming and going, swapping spent prisoners with new ones, it really put into perspective how important I am to the Sirius Law Enforcement Corporation.

Here, I'm alive. I have purpose. There's a reason I was never on one of those leaving ships, and that's because I'm something more. No authority can talk me down from doing something if I want to do so. I wasn't chosen for the Revenance, I chose it. Enkara, Uru, and the rest of them all bow down to me now.

The only thing I'm currently missing is a way to tap into those Modules, although I can partially emulate their power by directly controlling this outpost itself. And if that one kid - or whatever it is - ever wakes and is able to use those Modules, my Revenants will seize subject SK-3190's body, and bring it to me. And then, when I'm the last of my kind, I will finally have the tools to access that satellite and show the good work I've done here for the SLEC."
