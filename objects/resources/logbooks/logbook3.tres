text = "That old hag Gizzal bumped into me in the corridor again. I could swear it was not by accident. She’s been on my back ever since I installed augments into that kid a bit early on schedule. She should thank me for doing it at all, otherwise she’d be forced to! Even though this early experiment was a failure, it was worth it for the data alone. We’re short-staffed as it is, and Gizzal still cares to whine about morality. Just think about that, an ex-con lecturing me, a 14-star General, on ethics!
