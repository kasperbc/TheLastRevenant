name = "Energy Reactor Complex"
description = "I can feel it getting closer. The Energy Reactor Complex is a sign of things to come. This outpost wasn't built to last, or at least hasn't been maintained. One of the two massive reactors are down, which explains the poor ventilation of the Lab above. Something bloody is clogging up the energy intake tubes to the reactor, which might result in total meltdown if allowed to continue.

I understand now. Someone - or something - is trying to draw power from the outpost, and escape its confines.. The question is, why haven't they done so yet? Are they waiting for something? They're clearly a more sophisticated foe than the previous ones I've faced, which suggests they may be doing so.

I have to find a way out of here, and quick."
