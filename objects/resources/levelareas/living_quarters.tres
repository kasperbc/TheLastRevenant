description = "Area 3 | Living Quarters

The Living Quarters have an oddly enduring warm glow or aura still clinging to its walls. As its name suggests, it used to house all of the researchers and other personnel that called this outpost (at least some kind of) home. It still has that lasting touch of humanity, despite none of it still physically remaining. It fills me with a weird sense of nostalgia, a sad, almost offensive kind of introspection. I'm surprised I'm still capable of feeling such emotion.

As with the laboratory, security here has gone haywire, but it's somehow worse here. Even the wiring behind the wall panels has started crackling open, exposing dangerous electric currents. I might be able to fix this somehow, although I'm not sure, considering how widespread the problem is."
