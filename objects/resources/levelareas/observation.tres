description = "The Observation Deck would undoubtedly be the high point of anyone's career working here, even for me, despite not really caring for astronomy or databanks. Finally seeing outside the outpost - even if there is no calm, blue sky - is a downright lovely change of pace after countless corroded corridors.

If the entire point of this place was just about gazing longingly at an alien solar system, I ought to have visited here someday even without the persuasive threat of a death penalty. The majesty of the surrounding solar system isnâ€™t lost on me, despite my precarious situation and utter apathy towards outer space. What's wrong with fixing up things on the good ol' ground?

I can't stay fixated on the contrasting serenity of this place, though. My Prompter's scan on this area's atmospheric pressure suggests a hole somewhere in the deck's hull, which might compromise gravitational stability."
